# PEREGRIN

**Work in progress..**

A scrappy litlle tool which analyses cell migration data _(and who knows what else someday)_. It's partially functional, partially stupid, but it still might give a bit of insight and even could help with the interpretation of tracking data. Stick around or don't, big things could be coming though.
